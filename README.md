## Description

This project will simulate the frequencies of musical notes, and let you choose the durations.

## How to Use it

This project requires you to press keys on your keyboard to simulate sounds. Each of the keys are listed from low to high, lowest being at the bottom, highest being at the top.

                  C6  -> caps lock
                B5  -> l shift
              A5  -> l control
            G5  -> l alt
          F5  -> Right arrow
        E5  -> Left arrow
      D5  -> up arrow
    C5  -> down arrow

Press the corresponding keys to play the notes.

## How it Works

It works by taking the frequencies of each note, and when the key for that frequency is pressed, it plays the .wav file.
